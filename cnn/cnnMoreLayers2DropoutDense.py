# setting seeds to ensure reproducibility
# following the top answer on this post:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50659482/why-cant-i-get-reproducible-results-in-keras-even-though-i-set-the-random-seeds?rq=2
# seed_value = 16
# os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED']=str(seed_value)
# random.seed(seed_value)
# np.random.seed(seed_value)
# tf.random.set_seed(seed_value)
# however, unfortunately it might be difficult to ensure
# that the same results are observed in multiple environments.
# the results my local device might not be the same as the 
# marker's
# if this is the case, i'm honestly not sure how to fix it

# addendum: via post #440 on ed, cnn variability is expected
# since the global seeds were not working anyways, i decided
# to comment them out
