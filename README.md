# GTSRB-Traffic-Sign-Classification

Several machine learning techniques implemented to classify images of Traffic Signs, into 42 different classes (types of traffic signs). The training and test datasets were obtained from the ![German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign) (GTSRB). Implemented techniques include Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Convoluted Neural Network (CNN). More information, and analysis of each technique can be found in ![report.pdf](/report.pdf).

This was done as part of Assignment 2, in the University of Melbourne's Machine Learning course (COMP30027, Semester 1, 2025).
